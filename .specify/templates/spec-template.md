# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines - Full-Stack Development
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY („Éì„Ç∏„Éç„Çπ‰æ°ÂÄ§ÈáçË¶ñ)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (ÂÆüË£ÖË©≥Á¥∞„ÅØË®àÁîª„Éï„Çß„Éº„Ç∫„Åß)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üåê Consider both frontend UX and backend data flows
- üì± Multi-platform considerations (Web, Mobile, API)

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Full-Stack Context**: Consider both user-facing features and data processing needs

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas in Full-Stack projects**:
   - User types and permissions (RBAC requirements)
   - Data retention/deletion policies (GDPR compliance)
   - Performance targets and scale (concurrent users, data volume)
   - Error handling behaviors (frontend + backend)
   - Integration requirements (APIs, third-party services)
   - Security/compliance needs (authentication, authorization)
   - Multi-language support (i18n/l10n)
   - Cross-platform compatibility (browsers, devices)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Non-Functional Requirements *(Full-Stack considerations)*
- **NFR-001**: Performance - [e.g., "API responses < 200ms, Page load < 3s"]
- **NFR-002**: Scalability - [e.g., "Support 1000 concurrent users"]
- **NFR-003**: Security - [e.g., "HTTPS only, password hashing, OWASP compliance"]
- **NFR-004**: Availability - [e.g., "99.9% uptime, graceful degradation"]
- **NFR-005**: Compatibility - [e.g., "Chrome/Firefox/Safari, iOS/Android"]

### Integration Requirements *(if applicable)*
- **IR-001**: External APIs - [e.g., "Payment gateway integration"]
- **IR-002**: Data Sources - [e.g., "Connect to existing customer database"]
- **IR-003**: Third-party Services - [e.g., "Email service, file storage"]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
- **[Entity 3]**: [Cross-language data consistency requirements]
